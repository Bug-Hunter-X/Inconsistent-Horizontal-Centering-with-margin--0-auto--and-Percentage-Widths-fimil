The following CSS rule causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 50%;
}
```

This code intends to center a div horizontally. However, the `margin: 0 auto;` only works correctly if the div has a defined width. If the width is not set or is set to a percentage, the centering might not work as expected in all browsers.  Some browsers may interpret the percentage width relative to the parent container's content width, leading to inconsistent centering.
